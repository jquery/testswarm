## 1.0.0-pre

***NOT A RELEASE YET***

This major release features a complete rewrite of the front-end and back-end code base, and
adds several major features such as a brand new API, automatically synchronized run-client
settings and a new face using Twitter Bootstrap.

TestSwarm has also incorporated several optimizations for a continous integration workflow
where TestSwarm is used with Jenkins and BrowserStack (or similar services) by providing
detailed information about the swarm's state through "api.php?action=swarmstate". This new API
action lists all supported browsers including how many clients are online for each user agent
and if and how many pending runs there are. This makes it easy to then use this information to
automatically start or terminate browsers as needed in, for example, using the [BrowserStack
API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) and
[node-browserstack](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-browserstack). 

The database has remained the same mostly, although there are a few breaking change in some of
the relationships and column types. You are recommended to start clean as there is no practical
upgrade path. If needed, you could take note of the authentication token of your main account
in the "users.auth" column and after re-creating the the accounts on a new 1.0 TestSwarm,
manipulate the "users.auth" field in the database to match the old value. Other than that, no
data is to be imported from a pre-1.0 database.

* Implement basic caching for expansive operations in flat files in `./cache/`.
* Implement "debug" mode for the API (format=debug)

  Replaces the old Runresults page.
* Implemented Ping system. Used to keep track of which clients are online, and
  which may have lost network connection, crashed or else. Also used to keep the
  client side configuration up to date to allow long-live runner clients that

### Other changes

* (#121) Update jQuery from 1.3.2 to 1.7.1.
* (#70) Link to ScoresPage in the site menu.
* Drop redundant HTML5 attributes
* Use protocol-relative urls where possible for urls to third-party domains that support
  both HTTP and HTTPS.

* Add debug mode configuration to testswarm.ini.
* (#141) Old Perl example files in ./scripts/ that were no longer used or maintained have
  been removed from the repository.
* (#143) Using [phpbrowscap](https://github.com/garetjax/phpbrowscap) as user agent parser
  (data from <http://browsers.garykeith.com/>).
* The default `cooldown_sleep` has been lowered from 15 seconds to 2 seconds. The update rest
  period between points where there are no new tests is still 30 seconds, however.
* The HomePage now includes all information from the SwarmstateAction regarding the number of
  pending jobs for each user agent.
* The main site navigation now includes the projects list in a dropdown menu. This together
  with the new ProjectsPage has made individual project pages accessible from the HomePage
  for the first time.

  versions are now testable like any other browser.
