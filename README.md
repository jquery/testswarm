TestSwarm - Distributed Continuous Integration for JavaScript
=================

TestSwarm provides distributed continuous integration testing for
JavaScript.

The main instance monitoring jQuery core and related projects runs at
[swarm.jquery.org](http://swarm.jquery.org/).



Quick start
----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/jquery/testswarm.git`, or
[download the latest
release](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/zipball/master).



Versioning
----------

TestSwarm uses the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

The `-pre` suffix is used to indicate unreleased versions currently in
development.

Installation
-----------

To run TestSwarm you will need a web server, a database server and PHP.
At the moment TestSwarm only supports Apache and MySQL.

### Requirements

* Apache 2.0+
* PHP 5.2.3+
* MySQL 4.0+
* curl (for the cleanup action; see below)

### Install

1. Create a mysql database and a user who can connect and write to it.

1. Initialize the database:
   `mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < config/testswarm.sql`
   `mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < config/useragents.sql`

1. Copy `./config/testswarm-sample.ini` to `./testswarm.ini` and change the
   options to correspond to your MySQL database information.

1. Copy `./config/.htaccess-sample` to `./.htaccess`. If needed change the
   RewriteBase to match the contextpath configuration set in the testswarm.ini

1. Currently the only supported webserver is Apache (which uses a .htaccess
   file).<br/>
   To run testswarm from a non-root directory of Apache, modify the
   contextpath option in the testswarm.ini to fit for your needs, e.g.
   `contextpath = "/testswarm/"`.<br/>
   Test if `/testswarm/login` loads. If it doesn't, make sure your
   `.htaccess` is actually being read (e.g. by putting some jibberish into the
   `.htaccess` file, which should result in a HTTP 500 error). If it doesn't get
   loaded, make sure `AllowOverride` is set to "`All`" (at least not to
   "`None`") in your Apache configuration.

1. Copy `./config/robots.txt` to `./robots.txt` (or add similar rules to your
   main `robots.txt` file if TestSwarm is not in the root directory).

1. Create an entry to your crontab for action=cleanup. This performs various
   cleaning duties such as making timed-out runs available again for testing.
   `* * * * * curl -s http://example.org/api.php?action=cleanup > /dev/null`

History
---------------------

TestSwarm was originally created by [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) as a
basic tool to support unit testing of the [jQuery JavaScript
library](http://jquery.com). It was later moved to become an official
[Mozilla Labs](http://labs.mozilla.com/) and has since moved again to become
a [jQuery](http://jquery.org/) project.
