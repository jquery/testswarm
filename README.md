TestSwarm - Distributed Continuous Integration for JavaScript
=================

TestSwarm provides distributed continuous integration testing for JavaScript.

The main instance monitoring jQuery core and related projects runs at
[swarm.jquery.org](http://swarm.jquery.org/).



Quick start
----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/jquery/testswarm.git`, or [download
the latest release](https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/zipball/master).



Versioning
----------

TestSwarm uses the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

The `-pre` suffix is used to indicate unreleased versions currently in
development.

Installation
-----------

To run TestSwarm you will need a web server, a database server and PHP.
At the moment the only supported servers are Apache and MySQL.

### Requirements

* Apache 2.0+
* PHP 5.2.3+
* MySQL 4.0+
* curl (for the cleanup action; see below)

### Install

1. Create a mysql database and a user who can connect and write to it.

2. Initialize the database: 
   `mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < config/testswarm.sql`
   `mysql DBNAME -u USER -p < config/useragents.sql`

3. Copy the ./config/testswarm-sample.ini to ./testswarm.ini and change the
   options to correspond to your MySQL database information.

4. Copy the ./config/.htaccess-sample to ./htaccess. If needed change the
   RewriteBase to match the contextpath configuration set in the testswarm.ini

5. Currently the only supported webserver is Apache (which uses a .htaccess file).

   To run testswarm from a non-root directory of Apache, modify the contextpath option 
   in the testswarm.ini to fit for your needs, e.g. `contextpath = "/testswarm/"`.
   
   If you do so also update the `.htaccess` file, like so: `RewriteBase /testswarm/`

   Test if `/testswarm/login` loads.
   If it doesn't, make sure your .htaccess gets loaded (e.g. by putting some jibberish into the
   .htaccess file).
   If it doesn't get loaded, make sure `AllowOverride` is set to "`All`" (at least not to "`None`")
   in your Apache configuration.
   
6. Create an entry to your crontab for action=cleanup. This performs various
   cleaning duties such as making timed-out runs available again for testing.
   `* * * * * curl -s http://path/to/testswarm/api.php?action=cleanup > /dev/null`

History
---------------------

TestSwarm was originally created by [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/) as a basic
tool to support unit testing of the [jQuery JavaScript
library](http://jquery.com). It was later moved to become an official [Mozilla
Labs](http://labs.mozilla.com/) and has since moved again to become a
[jQuery](http://jquery.org/) project.
